                Eliza is one of the earliest examples of a natural language processing program, created in the 1960s by Joseph Weizenbaum. It simulates a conversation by identifying keywords in the user's input and responding with pre-defined phrases, often by rephrasing the userâ€™s statements as questions. For instance, if a user says, "I feel sad," Eliza might respond with, "Why do you feel sad?" This simple approach gives the illusion of understanding, but Eliza does not actually comprehend language; it only manipulates text based on pattern matching.
                
                <br> <br> In contrast, modern AI chatbots, powered by machine learning and deep neural networks, analyze vast datasets to generate responses that are more contextually relevant and nuanced. Unlike Eliza, which relies on fixed, shallow patterns, modern systems can interpret meaning, learn from interactions, and adapt their responses over time. These advancements allow contemporary AI to engage in more complex and meaningful conversations, although true human-like understanding remains an ongoing challenge.</p>
