		<h3 style="text-align:center;">Private Lessons</h3>
		<p>Although 1 on 1 chess lessons are the most popular with the most possible focus on the student, I am open to any other lesson configurations upon request. For optimal chess growth (saving time and money for the student), I recommend the combination of 1 on 1 lessons and group lessons. The length of the lesson is usually 1 hour, but 1.5 hours, and 2 hours sessions are also popular. Great opportunity for beginners, intermediate level, and advanced students to get solid foundation, building up their chess for even Nationals Master level and more. Open for any level.
