	<p>Why is topnotch instruction so highly recommended in chess? The deepest knowledge of chess's complexities can be conveyed only by a highly skilled player/coach. No doubt, it is possible to learn the rules in five minutes, but it might take decades to master chess. For a good example consider openings, one of the challenges of the royal game.
